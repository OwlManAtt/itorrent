/**
 * Background metadata downloader. 
 *
 * This script is not required; it simply supplements your RSS reader with
 * other pieces of useful data. There will be a lag time (the time depending
 * on how often you have this script run) between items showing up in the feeds
 * and items being cached. The new items will show up immediately, though - no 
 * worries about missing things.
 *
 * Put this script into cron (removing the space 
 * between the first star and slash, enjoy your PHP):
 * 
 *   * /5 *  *   *   *     /var/www/itorrent/bin/cache_torrent_metadata
 *
 * You will need to change the basedir in the chdir(). This makes include suck
 * less.
 * 
 * To enable metadata fetching/caching, set rss_feed.fetch_metadata = 'Y'.
 * The appropriate columns will show up in the GUI automatically.
 *
 * To have old metadata purged, set the rss_feed.metadata_expire_seconds field
 * to something. I'm a fan of holding on to things for about a quarter (7862400 
 * seconds), but pick whatever is appropriate for your feed/setup. If you set it 
 * to 0, metadata will never be purged.
 *
 * If you do NOT want to download metadata for certian torrents, use the RSS filter
 * feature described in the README. Any torrents that match a minimizing filter will
 * be skipped. 
 *
 * To enable debugging output for this script, set $verbose to true.
